And the raccoons, who had been watching people closely the whole time, finally came out of the shadows, and they started to adopt the best qualities of people.
\nTo their surprise, the people of this town started acting very reckless, literally, every raccoon has become one. And the name of the club inevitably grew into the Reckless Racoon Club. 
\nThe likely explanation for this recklessness was the unimaginable popularity of the Racoon Bar. Nightlife has consumed the club and raccoons have sensed the street life. But the noble life in this club will also bear fruit. `
